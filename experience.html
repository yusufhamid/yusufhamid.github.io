    During my junior year of high school 2013, I attended OneWorld Now! language and leadership camp for three weeks
    at Seattle Pacific University. </br>The OneWorld Now! language program focuses on a student-centered learning and interactive 
    approach to critical language learning. OWN offers Modern Standard Arabic classes or Mandarin Chinese classes, and I was
    in Modern Standard Arabic class. </br>The OneWorld Now! leadership program is foundation for creating the next generation of
    global leaders concerned with social justice and equality. The OWN leadership program guides students through the following 
    phases:  discovery, vision, action, and reflection.

In my sophomore year of high school 2012, I attended Muslim Youth Leadership Program. </br>
MYLP is an intense, exciting four day event in Seattle designed to introduce American Muslim youth to powerful 
careers where professionals have opportunities to shape public opinion and public policy as a course of their work. </br>
MYLP helps improve networking skills and Executive Office Visits four days of back-to-back meetings with local 
and national political leaders, high-powered executives of local TV and radio stations, law firms, public relations firms,
campaign management firms, and large philanthropic foundations at their own Seattle offices. </br>
As participant, it allowed me to open up my mind and consider different ways that we as young adults could give back to our communities.
